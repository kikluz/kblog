### Welcome to test


A CG artist is a digital artist that creates computer generated images(CGIs) for all types of multimedia. This can include 2D work or 3D assets that are used in games or animation.

Getting more specific, 2D assets are usually made using Adobe Photoshop or similar software and are usually used as textures or UIs(user interfaces/menus) in games. These assets can also be standalone digital artwork that can be used as marketing materials.

3D assets are mostly the models and digital properties that make the assets within a game or other interactive media. CG artists have a ton of software to pick from but some of the most common are Blender, 3DS Max, and Maya.

And these 3D assets can also be used to produce 2D renders that can then be used in the same way for promo material, packaging, etc.
